## Features

- **Custom UI Components**: The Poster Shop incorporates custom-designed UI components, including carousels, titles, buttons, and cards, crafted from scratch to ensure a unique and visually appealing shopping interface.

- **Hero Section**: The website features a Hero section that immediately captures users' attention with captivating visuals and compelling messages.
- **Containers-Components Design Pattern**: The Poster Shop follows a containers-components design pattern to separate state management and presentation components. This architecture enhances code organisation and maintainability.
- **Not Found Page**: In case a user navigates to a non-existent page, The Poster Shop provides a user-friendly Not Found page to ensure a seamless browsing experience.
- **Favorites and Shopping Cart Storage**: Users can add items to their favorites list and shopping cart. The website stores this data in the user's local storage, ensuring that their selections are preserved even if they leave or refresh the page.
